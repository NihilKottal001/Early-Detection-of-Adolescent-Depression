We aim to use Machine learning techniques such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression to identify the MDESI cases for multiple age groups ranging between 12-17years. This data is a sample subset data from the pool of entries who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2011-2017. Using findings from the logistic and Random Forest model, the goal was to find to identify potential MDESI cases. The logistic predictive model successfully identified 72.07% of the MDESI cases (recall rate) and accurately identified 69.4% of the MDESI cases and Non MDESI cases (accuracy rate) in the test dataset. Whereas the random forest model successfully identified 72.88% of the MDESI cases (Recall rate) and accurately identified 69.4% of the MDESI cases and Non MDESI cases (accuracy rate) in the test dataset. Results from this study confirmed that both logistic and random forest model when used as a classifier, can identify potential MDESI cases with acceptable recall and reasonable accuracy rates.
